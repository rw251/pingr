## A/B testing

Assume every test has two groups - "baseline" and "feature". "baseline" get the existing behaviour, "feature" get the new feature.

Create tests with UI

Each test then gets an entry in shared/ab/tests.js. Can be autogenerated with `node shared/ab/generate.js`

Names of tests must be unique
