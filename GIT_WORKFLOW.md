# PINGR Development Git Workflow

## Introduction

This document describes the software development workflow for PINGR, using Git and GitHub. It is based on the popular 'Feature Branch Workflow' strategy. 

The core approach is that all feature development and bug fixes take place in a dedicated branch.  Pull requests are then used to integrate new features back into the master branch.

This approach keeps the master branch free of code that might be broken or not yet ready for production, and it facilitates a colaborative approach to feature development.
